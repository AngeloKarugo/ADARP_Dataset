# Alcohol and Drug Abuse Reseach Program (ADARP) Dataset

ADARP dataset was collected from participants suffering from alcohol use disorder (AUD) and receiving treatment at an outpatient treatment agency druing 2019 - 2020, at Washington State University (WSU), Pullman, WA, USA.

This dataset is the outcome of a proof-of-concept pilot study to establish the feasibility of using a wearable sensor device to provide continuous monitoring of physiological stress in an ambulatory setting.  Based on a large literature that demonstrates alcohol relapse is associated with negative affect, alcohol-related cravings, and physiological stress, the proposed study included three components: 1) a 14-day daily diary study using ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of self-reported emotions, cravings, and stress via an internet survey, prompted four times daily; 2) a wearable Emaptica E4 wristband device that captures in real time continuous, physiological markers of stress, including heart rate, heart rate variability, and skin conductance to be worn by participants concurrently with the EMA component; and 3) a structured qualitative interview to be conducted following the EMA and continuous physiological markers components to assess participantsâ€™ experiences with the investigation and to validate self-reported and physiological markers of stress. With the proposed study, we aimed to address three research objectives. Aim 1 examines the fluctuations and associations among the self-reported emotions, alcohol-related cravings, and stress assessed in the EMA component. Analysis for Aim 1 centered on concurrent and lagged associations among negative affect, cravings, and stress. Aim 2 uses the continuous monitoring data acquired via the wearable device to visualize and describe fluctuations among the physiological measures of stress. Analysis for this aim focused on determining the degree of synchrony among the different physiological indicators. Aim 3 combines the EMA and continuous monitoring components in order to determine if self-reported changes in alcohol-related cravings can be predicted from physiological measures of stress.
